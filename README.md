## Rotate images

A work-in-progress C++ program to rotate images.

Run `make` to compile the program. Requires Magick++ library to be installed(install ImageMagick).

You may try using the pre-compiled program(`imgrotate`), but no guarantees that it will work.

Use like this: `./imgrotate -a some_angle input_file -o output_file`

#### To Do:
 - [X] start writing the program
 - [X] make the program work on one file first
 - [ ] make a nice command line interface
